Two important modeling concepts introduced critical to ensure data consistency & quality of your pipelines. 

➊ Idempotency
The ability of a data pipeline to produce the same results regardless of the date, time or how many times you run it.

❌ Don'ts:
→ Running INSERT without TRUNCATE = hi duplicates
→ Missing END_DATE in time windows = pipeline chaos
→ Skipping partition sensors = playing with fire

✅ Do's:
→ MERGE statements & window controls = best friends

-------------------------------------------------------------

➋ Slow Changing Dimensions (SDC)
Attributes that drift over time (ie. age, weight,...) for which you can track change history when modelled with the right type.

❌ Don'ts:
→ Type 1: tempting, but destroys historical accuracy
→ Type 3: a trap. Loses critical history between values

✅ Do's:
→ Type 2 with START_DATE/END_DATE tracking
→ Tip: an IS_CURRENT column = debugging lifesaver


🧠 Final thoughts:
1. Idempotency: not a feature but an insurance policy to your pipeline.
2. SCDs: type 2 looks complex, but it's your insurance policy to a peaceful night sleep.
